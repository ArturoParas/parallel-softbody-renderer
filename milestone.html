                        <p>
                          We aim to implement a parallel 3D soft body simulator on the NVIDIA GPUs
                          in the lab. Our approach to soft bodies will be to create a parallel
                          particle simulation program with “springs” between nearby particles,
                          which will ensure they stay close together, but allows for some give due
                          to the springs’ elastic forces. We have two potential reach goals: one is
                          to incorporate multithreading into the rendering process, so we can
                          interleave the process of rendering a frame with performing calculations
                          of subsequent frames, and the other is to render multiple soft bodies and
                          see how we can simulate interactions between them.

                        <h3 class="major"><span>Background</span></h3>
												<p>
                          We can divide our project into the following processes that can be
                          parallelized:
												</p>
                        <h4>Particle Position / Spring Updates</h4>
                        <p>
                          Across each frame, particles are undergoing identical calculations to
                          update their positions based on the forces applied to them. Additionally,
                          as seen in many soft body models [3], [4], particles can conduct these
                          updates completely independently of each other. Thus, this algorithm
                          lends itself extremely well to vectorization, as updating the position of
                          each particle represents completely identical and independent work that
                          can be done. Since springs are really just an abstract way to represent
                          forces between particles based on their distances, updating springs is
                          not a real step, but a consequence of updating particle positions.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Particle Collision Detection and Separation</h4>
                        <p>
                          After we update the positions of particles based on the forces applied to
                          them, particles need to detect if they overlap, and if they do, they need
                          to be separated. A naive approach would be to iterate through each
                          particle, and find the distance between the particle and every other
                          particle in the simulation. If this distance is less than the diameter of
                          one particle (we’ll say all particles have the same radius), then we know
                          they overlap. To separate them, we would move them in opposite
                          directions, each by half of the amount they overlap by, which would leave
                          them exactly touching. One thing to note is that during a pass of
                          particle collision detection and separation, we can’t guarantee that we
                          don’t create new collisions as a result. Thus, we must run multiple
                          iterations of this algorithm to ensure no collisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To reduce the work of this algorithm, we can first trim the number of
                          particles each particle has to check for collisions between. We can do
                          this by discretizing our space into a voxel grid, where each voxel has a
                          side length equal to the diameter of a particle. Inside of these voxels,
                          we can store pointers to particles whose centers lie inside the voxel.
                          Now, each particle only needs to check for collisions within the 3x3x3
                          region of voxels centered around the voxel that the particle is in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Now to parallelize this approach, we can note that on each pass of the
                          algorithm, all particles can detect their collisions and calculate their
                          updated positions at the same time, and only write those updates once all
                          particles have finished their computation. This means we can run vector
                          operations across voxels! Thus, this algorithm is extremely
                          parallelizable, as our space will be divided into thousands upon
                          thousands of voxels, which can each do completely independent work.
                        </p>
                        <h4>3D Multi-Threaded Renderer</h4>
                        <p>
                          In older technologies, a renderer will wait until all of a timestep’s
                          calculations have completed before beginning the process of drawing the
                          resulting frame to the screen. The implementation of such pipelines
                          forces calculations and rendering to be performed in sequence, which can
                          create non-negligible idle time for the GPU while it waits for a frame’s
                          calculations to complete, or conversely idle time for the CPU while it
                          waits for the drawing process to complete. As a result, modern
                          technologies can employ what is known as multi-threaded rendering. This
                          approach interleaves the drawing of frames with calculations for
                          subsequent frames in order to minimize the idle time of either component.
                          However, it also adds substantial complexity to the rendering process,
                          and requires custom integration between calculation and rendering phases
                          in order to maximize the efficiency of data passing and prevention of
                          data races.

                        <h3 class="major"><span>The Challenge</span></h3>
                        <p>
                          There are two main parts to this project – parallelizing the particle
                          position update step, and parallelizing the particle collision detection
                          and separation step. Additionally, our reach goal of interleaving the
                          process of rendering the current frame with computing the next frame
                          presents an optional third part. These three steps present unique
                          challenges to parallelization, detailed below.
                        </p>
												<h4>Particle Position Update</h4>
												<p>
                          We have identified multiple implementations of the spring-mass model
                          wherein the process of updating particle positions are independent of
                          each other within a frame. Thus, seeing as the calculations to update
                          each particle’s position are identical, we can leverage vectorized
                          calculations performed within CUDA blocks to parallelize particle
                          position updates as much as possible. The challenge comes in partitioning
                          the set of particles across CUDA blocks, particularly since particles
                          need to read the positions of  the particles that they are connected to
                          in order to calculate the elastic forces that are exerted upon them.
                          There is one key assumption that holds throughout the simulation that
                          makes this calculation substantially easier: a particle’s connectivity is
                          fixed. Thus, on the simulation’s startup, before any calculations are
                          performed, we may precompute a partition of the particles based on their
                          connectivity that adequately balances load. We can then use this
                          partition throughout the simulation, assigning chunks of the partition to
                          CUDA blocks to ensure load balancing, as well as optimal use of shared
                          memory.
												</p>
                        <h4>Particle Collision Detection and Separation</h4>
                        <p>
                          We want to execute the parallelism here in CUDA, due to the high
                          resolution grid we will partition our space into, and the fact that we
                          can vectorize the computation across cells in the grid. The challenge in
                          doing this comes in the way in which we partition the voxel grid across
                          GPU blocks to minimize accesses to global memory whilst preserving
                          correctness. Noting that each voxel requires a neighborhood of 3x3x3
                          centered around itself to perform collision resolution, we aim to assign
                          CUDA blocks work at a per-neighborhood granularity, placing all of the
                          relevant information pertaining to the neighborhood into the block’s
                          shared memory before starting collision resolution. Though this approach
                          works very well within the neighborhood, it is entirely possible for a
                          particle to get pushed into an adjacent voxel during collision
                          resolution, in which case global memory accesses would be needed to
                          communicate this transfer for subsequent collision resolution iterations.
                          We plan on experimenting with ways of optimizing this transfer, including
                          creating input/output buffers to store such transfers between collision
                          resolution iterations or perhaps propagating these updates after multiple
                          rounds of collision resolution, and ignoring them for all other
                          iterations.
                        </p>
                        <h4>3D Multi-Threaded Renderer</h4>
                        <p>
                          We will begin by having a fence between the calculation and rendering
                          steps of the simulation. That is, initially, all calculations for a given
                          frame will be completed before the renderer begins drawing the particles
                          in their respective positions. Though this implementation is simple, it
                          will likely not scale well, as the total time to render a frame will be
                          fixed at the sum of calculation time for the frame and draw time for the
                          frame. Seeing as we aim to render thousands of particles at a smooth
                          frame rate, we must interleave these steps in order to ensure the maximum
                          utilization of our resources. In other words, while a given frame is
                          being drawn, we will allow available resources to begin calculations for
                          the next frame, effectively decoupling the calculation and drawing
                          phases. This is known as multi-threaded rendering, and there are a few
                          considerations to keep in mind when implementing such a system. Namely,
                          we must ensure that the particle positions for each frame are stored in
                          memory only until the frame has finished rendering. Otherwise, the memory
                          footprint of storing frame information would become too great, and could
                          possibly cause crashes or overflows. We must implement a flagging process
                          to ensure that frame data is not read by the renderer while calculations
                          are still being performed. Lastly, we will have to experiment with
                          methods of efficiently communicating frame data to the process that is in
                          charge of the renderer, as if not dealt with properly, the communication
                          overhead of passing frame data between processes can become a substantial
                          bottleneck.

                        <h3 class="major"><span>Goals and Deliverables</span></h3>
												<h4>Main Deliverable</h4>
												<p>
                          The main deliverable we plan on producing is a 3D spring particle sim for
                          rendering soft bodies. We hope to be able to run the sim and render the
                          results in real time. This means we hope to run the whole sim / render
                          pipeline at a rate of at least 30 Hz. As for particle count and spring
                          count, we’re hoping to render at least 10k particles in real time, as the
                          research we’ve done indicates that 10k particles seems to be a common
                          benchmark for stress testing. We also plan on rendering 26 springs per
                          particle, leaving us with an estimate of about 130k springs (each spring
                          connects two particles, so 260k springs would be double counting each
                          spring). We’re not sure how this large number of springs will affect
                          performance, so our particle count goals are open to change.
                          Additionally, we plan on analyzing the effects on performance of particle
                          count, number of springs per particle, and particle size.
												</p>
                        <h4>Reach Deliverables</h4>
                        <p>
                          If time permits, we hope to extend our project by incorporating
                          multithreading into the rendering process. We also hope to implement a
                          way to allow for collisions of soft bodies. The current issue with our
                          algorithms is that if two soft bodies collide, then the particles could
                          interleave. This is not the behavior we want, as we want soft bodies to
                          remain independent structures. However, we’re currently unsure how to
                          approach this extension, thus it is a reach deliverable.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Poster Board Session Demo</h4>
                        <p>
                          Our demonstration at the poster session will be a live spring particle
                          simulation and rendering. The main demo we want to show is of dropping a
                          soft sphere onto various rigid shapes and seeing how it falls and how it
                          squishes / bounces as it collides.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Additionally, we will provide graphs on how sensitive our performance is
                          to the number of particles, number of springs per particle, and the size
                          of particles. Finally, we will provide speedup graphs across different
                          iterations of our project, which will be developed as follows: 1) All
                          algorithms sequential. 2) Parallel particle position updates. 3) Parallel
                          particle collision detection and separation. 4) (Reach) multithreading
                          the rendering process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We will provide one additional demo of two soft body spheres colliding
                          with each other if we manage to get collision between soft bodies
                          working.

                          We will use OpenGL, as it is a C++ graphics library that has the
                          capability to render 3D shapes using GPU draw calls, and it has extensive
                          documentation. Additionally, it gives us very fine grained control of
                          when things are drawn, giving us the chance to pursue multi-threaded
                          rendering if time permits.

                        <h4>Spring Particle Sim</h4>
                        <p>
                          Since our algorithms lend themselves extremely well to vectorized
                          instructions, we plan on writing our code in CUDA. Thus, we will use the
                          gates machines we used for lab 2 to take advantage of their GPUs.

												<p>
                          Nov 17 - Have independent particle motion and collision working and
                          rendered. <br>
                          Nov 24 - Have spring mass system working; plan for parallelizing should
                          be in place and parallelization implementation should be started. <br>
                          Dec 1 - Parallelization of simulation pipeline should be approaching
                          completion. <br>
                          Dec 8 - Parallelization should be completed, only polishing should
                          remain. <br>
                          Dec 15 - Final Deadline, both simulation and report should be finalized.

                          We plan on using the gates machines we used for lab 2, as they have the
                          GPUs we need for our project. We also plan on programming our spring
                          particle sim in CUDA to be able to take full advantage of these GPUs. We
                          plan on using OpenGL to render our particle sim, but other than that we
                          will write everything from scratch.

                          We do have some papers which we used as a reference to come up with our
                          proposal, and we will continue to use as references as we develop our
                          project:
